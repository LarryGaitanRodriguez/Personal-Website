                            To put to work the first skills learned from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum, the website asks that users create
                            a tribute/bio website of a famous person. At the time I choose president Barak Obama. The Website is made of
                            basic
                            HTML and CSS and no frameworks.

                                One of the bigger first projects of freeCodeCamp, the portfolio was meant to be a project in itself and
                            and it was meant to show off other projects. This website is made of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

                            One of the first homeworks in my Computer Science I class, we were tasked to make
                            a program that asked the user the amount of Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes they wanted to convert into
                            seconds.
                            I wrote up a much more detailed exponation on what were the requirements and restrictions, what it does, and
                            what I learned.
                            That write up can be found in the links down below.
